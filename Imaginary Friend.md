**👾 Imaginary Friend 👾**

Have a world and no one to share it with? Feeling uninspired? Don't like people but want to GM? Like needless complexity?

An **Imaginary Friend** can be modelled with as much or as little depth as you choose. Use as much or as little as you want.

I made this because I got into solo roleplaying recently with Ironsworn, but struggled with role playing, I mostly liked the world building, but no one wanted to play with me. So I just made a friend out of dice, meters, tokens, tables, and an unwillingness to go outside. I've also included a picture of a little prototype of a... dashboard, I guess, that I'm working on to make it simpler.

I've done some tentative play testing but any feedback or opinions are welcome. Disclosure: AI was used in the organization of this, and credit goes to tam b and their Pettish system for being the main inspiration.

### 👾 Player Creation 👾

To create a Player:

🎲 Roll 1d6 and convert it to a 1d3:

| 🎲 Roll | Result |
|--------|--------|
| 1–2    | 1      |
| 3–4    | 2      |
| 5–6    | 3      |

🎲 Then roll that many **Personality Tags** from the tables below. These represent the Player’s emotional disposition and core behavioral leanings.

---

### 🧠 Personality Clusters

Each cluster has a theme and six tags. Use the cluster number and the tag number together (e.g. **1.5 Warm**) for d66 reference.

### 🔋 Drive: The Player’s Subconscious Anchor

A **Drive** represents the Player’s deep subconscious motivation.  
It anchors long-term behavior, shapes Memory formation, and biases future personality drift.

Each Player has **one Drive** by default. It can change **narratively** (but rarely).

---

### 🔋 Drive Mechanics

#### ➕ Permanent Bias
Each Drive grants a **+1 Bias Point** toward its related **Personality Cluster**.

#### 🧩 Drive and Memory
Drives influence **Memory Token** formation:
- Events tied to a Drive are more likely to become memories.
- These tokens resist decay and escalate faster.

---

### 🎛️ Drive Meter (–3 to +3)

Tracks how fulfilled the Player’s Drive feels.

| Level | State       | 🎬 GM Prompt                             |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| -3    | Underserved | Create a scene that meets their Drive.   |
| -2    | Hungry      | Look for ways to feed the Drive.         |
| -1    | Itching     | Watch for opportunities to engage it.    |
| 0     | Balanced    | No special action needed.                |
| +1    | Satisfied   | Let them enjoy Drive-themed moments.     |
| +2    | Energized   | Consider pivoting narrative focus soon.  |
| +3    | Overserved  | Shift spotlight or cool the Drive’s arc. |

---

### 🎲 Drive Assignment

At character creation:

- 🎲 Roll 1d6 to assign a **random Drive**
- Or align Drive to a chosen **Personality Cluster**
- Conflicting Drives and Tags are **allowed** (and fun)

| 🎲 | 🔋 Drive       |
|----|----------------|
| 1  | Belonging      |
| 2  | Recognition    |
| 3  | Safety         |
| 4  | Freedom        |
| 5  | Novelty        |
| 6  | Creation       |

---

✅ **Tip**: Drives aren’t chains. They evolve with the Player. Let big moments change them.


---

### 💎 Drive · Token · Cluster Mapping

Each **Drive** links to:

- a pair of opposing **Memory Tokens**
- a related **Personality Cluster**

Matching tokens reinforce the Cluster. Conflicting ones cause drift or tension.

| 💎 Drive       | 🎭 Token Pair            | 🧠 Cluster             |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Belonging     | Connection / Rejection   | Expressive            |
| Recognition   | Triumph / Injustice      | Conflict-Oriented     |
| Safety        | Restraint / Loss         | Guarded               |
| Freedom       | Growth / Sacrifice       | Impulsive             |
| Novelty       | Joy / Excess             | Intense               |
| Creation      | Repair / Catharsis       | Harmonizer            |

---

### 🧭 Agenda · 🎭 Focus · 🕯️ Secret Motivation

Each Player has **three behavioral anchors**:

- **Agenda** — What the Player wants from the experience of playing.
- **Focus** — Their current mood or approach this session.
- **Secret Motivation** — A hidden want, fear, or goal. Different from Drive; it's interpretive and private.

 ✅ These are rolled separately.  
 ✅ Focus may shift between sessions.  
 ✅ Agenda and Motivation rarely change.

---

### 🎲 Flat Roll System (2–12 without curve)

Use this to flatten a 2d6 result:

1. Roll 1d6. Reroll any 1s.  
2. Roll a second d6:  
   - If even: **add +6** to the first die.  
   - If odd: keep the first result.  

---

### 🧭 Agenda (Flat 2d6 at character creation)

| 🎲  | 🧭 Agenda   | Prompt Question                                  |
| --- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 2   | Drama       | What’s the worst thing to reveal right now?      |
| 3   | Instigator  | What oblivious trouble can they spark?           |
| 4   | Impulsive   | What’s the temptation and how do they indulge?   |
| 5   | Team Player | What’s the optimal action for the group?         |

| 8   | Safe        | What’s the most expected, low-risk move?         |
| 9   | Virtuoso    | How can their strength or flair shine?           |
| 10  | Author      | What backstory detail shapes this scene?         |
| 11  | Explorer    | What unseen angle or place begs attention?       |
| 12  | Agreeable   | What helps another player most right now?        |

---

### 🎭 Focus / Mood (Flat 2d6 at session start)

| 🎲 | 🎭 Focus        | Theme |
|----|----------------|--------------------------|
| 2  | Playful        | Relaxing, entertaining, chilling |
| 3  | Serious        | Focused on a long-term goal |

| 12 | Apathetic      | Emotionally checked-out |

---

### 🕯️ Secret Motivation (d66)

What the Player is hiding. It could be personal, silly, heavy, or redemptive.

| 🎲  | 🕯️ Motivations |     |            |     |             |
| --- | --------------- | --- | ---------- | --- | ----------- |

| 64  | Chaos           | 65  | Truth      | 66  | Balance     |

---

✅ **Tip**  
This is a great time to name the Player, invent an occupation, or sketch a bit of background.

---

### ❗ Reaction Roll System

Roll **2d6** when the narrative echoes a Player’s **Trigger** or whenever a Reaction is needed.  
Each Personality Cluster has a unique, weighted Reaction Table.  
Use the **General Reaction Table** if the dominant cluster is unclear.

---

#### ❗ General Reactions

| 🎲 | Reaction               | Meaning                                  |
|----|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1  | 💡 Insight / Idea       | Adds a plan, clue, or new connection      |
| 2  | ❓ Ask a Question        | Seeks clarity or pushes curiosity         |
| 3  | 😏 Joke / Comment        | Humor, side-remark, or light sarcasm      |
| 4  | ⛔ Undermine / Challenge | Blocks, doubts, or criticizes             |
| 5  | 😤 React Emotionally     | Anger, joy, tears—strong visible feeling  |
| 6  | 😶‍🌫️ Withdraw           | Goes quiet, deflects, or leaves           |

---

### 🎲 Tone Die

Use the **Tone Die** to color a Reaction or Dialogue.  
Roll 2d6 and interpret the result:

- **2–3** = Very Negative  
- **4–5** = Negative  
- **6–8** = Neutral  
- **9–10** = Positive  
- **11–12** = Very Positive

---

### ❗ Cluster-Specific Reaction Tables

Use the Player’s **Dominant Cluster** to determine which table to roll on.

### 🧩 Memory System

Memories are stored as **Tokens** tied to meaningful emotional events.  
You can hold up to **12 tokens** at once. If full, gaining a new token triggers a **Decay Check** on the oldest.

Tokens are gained either:
- Narratively (through scenes), or  
- When the fiction reflects a Player's **Personality Tags**, **Drive**, or **Cluster**.

Each Token has:
- A **Positive side** (e.g. Joy, Connection)
- A **Negative side** (e.g. Loss, Rejection)

They are linked to **Personality Clusters** and influence future behavior.

---

### 🔗 Token Pair Reference (by Cluster)

| Cluster           | 🔺 Positive  | 🔻 Negative   |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Expressive        | Connection   | Regret         |
| Guarded           | Restraint    | Rejection      |
| Impulsive         | Joy          | Loss           |
| Intense           | Catharsis    | Excess         |
| Conflict-Oriented | Triumph      | Injustice      |
| Harmonizer        | Repair       | Sacrifice      |

---

### 📶 Memory Intensity

As memories deepen, they gain **Bias Power** and become harder to decay.

| Level   | Bias | Description                        |
|---------|------|------------------------------------|
| 1       | +1   | Brief impact or surface impression |
| 2       | +2   | Moderate emotional weight          |
| 3       | +3   | Strong, persistent emotional pull  |
| Core    | +2   | Permanent; grants or strengthens a Tag |

🧩 **Core Memories** do not decay unless rewritten by story (e.g. healing, transformation).

---

### 🔄 Decay Check

When gaining a new Token, roll 1d6 for the **oldest memory**:

| Level   | 🎲 Roll to Decay |
|---------|------------------|
| 1       | 1–3              |
| 2       | 1–2              |
| 3       | 1                |

If the Token **survives**, it **escalates** to the next level.

---

### ⏫ Escalation Rule

If a memory survives its Decay Check:

| From → To  | New Bias | Notes                                     |
|------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Level 1 → 2| +2       | Memory grows deeper                       |
| Level 2 → 3| +3       | Emotion becomes powerful                  |
| Level 3 → Core | +2   | Becomes permanent; grants or reinforces a Tag |

✅ Gaining a Core Memory allows you to:
- Add a new relevant **Personality Tag**, or  
- Mark an existing Tag with a **+**, signaling it gives **+1 Bias**.

---

### ♻️ Reinforcement & Closure

- **Reinforcement**: Move the Token to the top of the stack. May increase intensity.
- **Closure (Decay)**: Token may be weakened or erased. Can be a **narrative decision**, not just a roll.

---

### 🎚️ Bias Point System

Used to determine a Player’s **Dominant Cluster**  
(for **Reaction Rolls** and **PC Actions**).

| Source               | Bias Points |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Personality Tag      | +2          |
| Reinforced Tag (+)   | +3          |
| Memory Token Level 1 | +1          |
| Memory Token Level 2 | +2          |
| Memory Token Level 3 | +3          |
| Core Memory          | +2          |

🪙 In a tie: GM chooses or rolls randomly.

---

### 🧩 Core Memories

- Permanent  
- Grant or reinforce a Personality Tag  
- Do not decay unless **rewritten by fiction**

---

🧩 **Token Flow**  
Gain → Add to Stack  
→ If full: Decay Check (oldest Token)  
  ↳ Fail = Erase  
  ↳ Survive = Escalate (1→2→3→Core)  
    ↳ Core = Permanent, grants or reinforces Tag  
→ Reinforce = Move to top / increase intensity  
→ Closure = Optional decay by story

---
## 👥 Table Behavior 👥

These mechanics emulate Player behavior **out of character**—the things they do “at the table.”  
You can use an **Imaginary Friend** to simulate a single Player, multiple Players, or even NPCs and party members.

---

### ✨ Spark

Models how Players latch onto characters, locations, objects, factions, or story elements in surprising ways—creating emergent favorites.

#### 🎲 Spark Roll

When introducing a new element (character, location, object, faction, etc.), roll **1d6** per Player.  
On a **6**, the Player Sparks immediately.

**Bias Modifiers:**
- +1 if aligned with Player’s 🔋 Drive  
- +1 if aligned with Player’s 🧠 Dominant Cluster  
- *(Optional: +1 for novelty or breaking patterns)*  
- **Max bonus = +2 → Spark on 4–6**

#### 📈 Spark Meter (0–3)

- Fail a Spark Check → +1 to the Spark Meter  
- At 3, the next Spark Check auto-succeeds  
- After a Spark, reset to 0

#### ✨ Spark Effects

- The Sparked element is now emotionally “sticky”  
- Player engages with it more often (comments, attention, action)  
- GM should weave it into future scenes  
- Sparks build gradually—they don’t burst into obsession

✅ **Design Notes**  
- Only roll for narratively meaningful elements  
- Use once per Player per new element  
- Sparks accumulate meaning over time

---

### ⚡ Energy

Simulates table vibe—emotional excitement, impulsiveness, or tension.  
Starts at **0**. Raise or lower as fits the scene.

At **Energy 1+**, roll **1d6** as the **Energy Die** during a Reaction, Tone check, or intense moment.  
If the roll is **≤ Energy**, trigger the Energy Table and then reduce Energy by 1.

#### ⚡ Energy Table (1d6)

| 🎲 | Flashpoint        |
|----|-------------------|
| 1  | Blurt — A shocking confession bursts out |
| 2  | Escalate — Conflict erupts, stakes rise |
| 3  | Fixate — Obsessive focus on something unresolved |
| 4  | Shift Focus — Scene pivots to a new goal or topic |
| 5  | Reach Out — Sudden emotional plea or gesture |
| 6  | Withdraw — Shuts down, leaves, or closes off |

---

### 🌪 Chaos

A long-term tension meter for instability or disruption.  
Unlike Energy, Chaos builds slowly and hijacks PC behavior dramatically.

#### ⬆️ Chaos Increases by +1 when:
- A 🔋 Drive Event is resolved (reaching +3 or –3)  
- An ⚡ Energy Flashpoint occurs at **Energy = 6**

#### 🌪️ Chaos Surge (at Chaos 3)

Trigger a **Chaos Mood Hijack** the next time the Player acts.  
Roll on the Chaos Table and **reset Chaos to 0** after resolution.

#### 🎲 Chaos Table (1d6)

| 🎲 | Mood Injection |
|----|----------------|
| 1  | Absurd — Do it the weirdest way possible |
| 2  | Rebellious — Disrupt or challenge expectations |
| 3  | Comedic — Exaggerate or showboat |
| 4  | Impulsive — Act without thinking |
| 5  | Dramatic — Make it emotionally overblown |
| 6  | Inventive — Propose something strange or clever |

💥 **Note:** Chaos is a tone hijack, not a derail. The Player’s action stays rooted in the scene—just twisted by mood.

### 🫂 Bonds

Models emotional closeness between Players.  
Each pair shares a **12-step Bond Track**.

#### 🎲 Bond Roll (1d6)

| 🎲 | Result        |
|----|---------------|
| 1–2 | No change     |
| 3–4 | +1 progress   |
| 5   | +2 progress   |
| 6   | +3 progress   |

Use when: emotional scenes, shared teamwork, tension, or support occurs.  
Bond strength influences roleplay, memory impact, and collaboration.
